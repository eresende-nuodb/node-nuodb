## Project Plan

The plan has three phases.

The goal in the first phase is to learn about the challenges and problem space.
Doing this we surface the breadth of challenges early, we can more accurately
scope the project since the complexities are fully known, and now knowing the
challenges and how to address those challenges we are in a better position to
mete out work to others as subsequent work is effectively a mechanical exercise.
The steps and current statuses of the first phase are:

|   STEP  |   STATUS  |  DURATION |
|---------|:-------------:|------:|
| Builds  | DONE | 1d |
| Docker  | DONE | 1d |
| Async   | DONE | 2d |
| Promise | DONE | 1d |
| Await   | DONE | 1d |

The goal of the second phase is to complete the integration of each work area,
inclusive of unit tests. The steps and current status are:

|   STEP  |   STATUS  |  DURATION |
|---------|:-------------:|------:|
| Commit        | --- | 2d |
| Execute       | --- | 2d |
| Results       | --- | 5d |
| Prepare       | --- | 5d |
| RO Properties | --- | 2d |
| Sync | --- | 5d |

The goal of the third phase is to stabilize and tune the integration.

|   STEP  |   STATUS  |  DURATION |
|---------|:-------------:|------:|
| Memory Leaks / Tuning  | --- | 5d |
| Documentation | --- | 1d |
